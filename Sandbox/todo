------------------------------------------------
0. Priority
    - Recipes: finish required features
        - FIX: editors set values after a right click

    - Extensions:
        - move from version to components
        (reason: geo.abc, geo.blend, geo.ma, etc., should stay separated)
        - migration + refactors + update export table and ingredients uis


1. Missing primary features

    - Processes:
        - test & fix import of inputs with process relaunch in jobs_list
        - filters

    versions list: replace every button with a toolbar
        - new file ( + icon)
        - increment (arrow-up icon)
        - edit comment
        - 1 additional button for each available process: build / export / review

    - Users
        - per project information
            - roles (sup / lead / graphist / pipe)
            - favorite_assets
            - recent_assets
       --> probably a Contributor/Member/PrUser/SubUser document in project_documents, with source_user and the needed extra fields
          it is a user with extra project-related fields
          can be found with BreezeApp.sub_user

    - switch menu for User / Project
        - ui to create them

    - Admin tab: Guis to create and manage db items
        - Users (for the current project): add users to project / assign roles
        - Stage Templates
            - process assignment
            - create, delete, icon, color, label, category_filters, assigned_users, etc

    - ExportsTable:
        - mvd
        - context menu

    - Asset groups
    - Asset data / properties

------------------------------------------------

2. Cleans / Refactors
    - mvd: confo and simplify from new knowledge, update stages' mouse events from component tree's code
    - SoftwareClasses: sub-classes for in/out, file management, etc.
    - group searchbars into the same parent class
    - list of possible component name, to be referenced in recipes and used in export processes
            it will be easier to update all the names at once for a given component

------------------------------------------------

3. Qol / Upgrades to existing features
    - process_launcher:
        - cache, remember selected processes and inputs: stage: process ; process: inputs
        - preset the input's height + scroll area to have a fixed size window

    - Turbine:
        - refresh jobs on tab shown, don't refresh if number has not changed
        - show processes and steps duration
        - relaunch process with same inputs

    - copy / paste users and status with ctrl+C/ctrl+V

    - StageTemplateList assignment:
        - warn if a used stage template is about to be deleted
        - ui to omit or keep them
        - gui to edit recipes

    - save the gui's state between instances

    - add error messages to steps in step viewer

    - Stage Templates: status and users history

    - Asset browser: favorites / recent
    - Asset browser: god-mode with 'new' buttons under each part

    - Ingredient Slots: components history
